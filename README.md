Collatz-Conjecture-Java(Timed using millis())
=======================

Also known as the 3n+1 problem on SPOJ/Codechef

One of the most notorious problems in elementary mathematics that remains unsolved is the Collatz conjecture,
concerning the function {f_0: {\bf N} \rightarrow {\bf N}} defined by setting {f_0(n) := 3n+1} when {n} is odd, 
and {f_0(n) := n/2} when {n} is even. (Here, {{\bf N}} is understood to be the positive natural 
numbers {\{1,2,3,\ldots\}}.)
